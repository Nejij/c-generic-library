= How to Compile =

Like the most linux tools you can compile the library by using following shell commands;

{{{
./configure
make
}}}


The compiled libraries should be found in the hidden directory ./lib. By default there should be a static and a dynamic library.


= Trouble? =

If you have problem by using the commands above you can recreate the configure script. You must install the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_build_system autotools]. To create the configuration script run the commands:



{{{
autoreconf -i
automake --add-missing
}}}
