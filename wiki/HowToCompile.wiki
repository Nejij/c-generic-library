= How to Compile =

Like the most linux tools you can compile the library by using following shell commands;

{{{
./configure
make
}}}


The compiled libraries should be found in the hidden directory ./lib. By default there should be a static and a dynamic library.


= Trouble? =

Make sure that 2.67 version of autotools or later is installed. They can be downloaded from this [http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/autoconf/2010-08/msg00010.html release note].
Make sure that you run make clean.
Make sure that your system is using libtool 2.2.6b from [http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/ here].
If you have problem by using the commands above you can recreate the configure script. You must install the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_build_system autotools 2.68]. To create the configuration script run the commands:



{{{
autoreconf -i
automake --add-missing
}}}
